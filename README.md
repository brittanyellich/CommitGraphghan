# GitHub Commit Graphghan

This is a project originally made from a GitHub Spark which I made into a full app! Thank you GitHub Spark for helping me prototype this :heart:

## Development instructions

1. Add a `.env` file with `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` mapping to a localhost:8888 GitHub Oauth project
2. Run `netlify dev`

## Contributing

Anyone can feel free to submit a pull request or an issue suggestion to make this better :heart:
